# Lab 08: Stack Applications (Tower of Hanoi)

This Lab is basically application of Stacks. There are three stacks which have "n" number of elements on Stack A (source) and our task is to move all disks to the Stack C (destination). Stack B is an intermediate or spare Stack.

## Rules

* Only one disk may be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the tower and sliding it onto another tower.
* No disks may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Task

* The Task is to implement the Game and print the address of the disk.
