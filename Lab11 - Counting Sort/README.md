# Lab 11: Counting Sort

## Tasks

1. Print the number of times each number appears. (Don't Sort Yet.)
2. Actually apply Counting Sort
3. Given a list of integers and strings sort and print the strings in the order of their accompanying integers but with a "TWIST". The Twist is that there is no need to print the first half of the original array, instead print '-' in place of those elements.
